# ByteTrack-MOT-with-UI-YOLOX-
This repository is intended to focus on analyzing the instances movements in a scenario using multiple object tracking with ByteTrack and YOLOX approach.

Below are the output of the ByteTracker algorithm along with YOLOX-x model weights.

Track threshold = 0.5
track buffer = 30 frame
match threshold = 0.8

You can see here how the algorithm keeps track of the same person with his ID even with a slight amount of occulsion:
